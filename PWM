TCCR0B = 0; // Halt counter by setting clock select bits to 0 (No clock source).
            // This keeps anyhting from happeneing while we get set up
TCNT0 = 0x00;     // Start counting at bottom.
OCR0A = 0; // Set TOP to 0. This effectively keeps us from counting becuase the counter just keeps
           // reseting back to 0.
           // We break out of this by manually setting the TCNT higher than 0, in which case it
           // will count all the way up to MAX and then overflow back to 0 and get locked up again.
OCR0B = 2; // max width (must be greater than TCNT0 - see
           // https://github.com/bigjosh/TimerShot/blob/master/TimerShot.ino)
TCCR0A = _BV(COM0B1) | _BV(COM0B0) | _BV(WGM00) | _BV(WGM01);
TCCR0B =  _BV(WGM02)|_BV(CS02) | _BV(CS00);
DDRD |= 1 << PD0;     // Set pin to output

Try to do analogously to PC7:

pin OC4A
TCCR4A
TCCR4B
DDRC |= 1 << PC7;
TCNT4
OCR4A
OCR4B
